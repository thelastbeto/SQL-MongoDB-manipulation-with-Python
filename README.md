# SQL-MongoDB-manipulation-with-Python
 ## In this project, I manipulated some data by transporting it from one database to another using SQL commands with the Python language.
 ### First demand
  The first demand was requested by our data science team, where they were asked to make the company's raw data available so that they could carry out analysis.
<br><br>
  How did I help them?
<br><br>
  Firstly, I verified that the data had a key and value format resembling Python dictionaries and also JSON formats. With this, I came to the conclusion that the best option
for availability it would be in MongoDB.
<br><br>
### Second demand
  The second demand was requested by our BI team, in which they need this data processed and structured in a database so that they can make insights
and analyzes in order to offer a better vision for the company.
<br><br>
  How did I help them?
<br><br>
  I transformed and cleaned the data using the Pandas library, then made it available in tables in MySQL. Finally, I extracted the data, and, still
using pandas, I passed them to CSV so that the BI team had a better view of their analyzes and insights.
